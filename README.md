# Wiki

Wiki is an implementation of a simple wiki in Go.

## Page syntax

The page syntax is a simplified version of Markdown.

```
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph. A new line indicates a new paragraph.

Links are between square brackets: [Australia] is a link that points to the page titled "Australia".
```
